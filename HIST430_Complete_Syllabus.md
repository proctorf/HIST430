Drawing together the histories of four continents, Europe, Africa, North America and South America, this course will allow you to explore the nature and meaning of the new Atlantic world created as a consequence of the Columbian encounter.  In our readings and in your own research projects we will explore the “History of the Atlantic World” through the experiences of the men and women who inhabited it from the mid-fifteenth century through approximately 1890. The Atlantic Ocean itself, then, can potentially function as a frontier or conduit in your research. As we will see, a volatile mixture of people and pathogens, of labor systems and crops, of colonies, empires, nations, and subjects, contributed to the painful and unexpected emergence of this new Atlantic community.

A key component of that exercise and exploration will be to challenge histories grounded in national narratives. In our discussions and in your research we will attempt to connect and combine the various histories of Europe, Africa, and the Americas, and to demonstrate how many important processes of change can be understood through an international frame of reference.

This course is intended to serve as a capstone experience of your history career at Denison, and should bring together much of what you have learned about writing and researching history in your other classes.  As a result, a key component of this course is your opportunity to produce an independent, original, article-length research paper grounded in primary materials.

***NOTE*** - This is a capstone experience, as such it will likely be on of the most intense and hopefully rewardings experiences of your History major. 

***Readings:***  Required readings for the course are listed on the syllabus. Book chapters will be available on the course schedule website for download and printing. Students are expected to locate and print journal articles.  Students are expected to have completed the assigned reading prior to the class period for which they are assigned.  Please bring your readings to class. 

***Required Books:*** (Available in the Bookstore)
Randy Sparks, The Two Princes of Calabar: An Eighteenth-century Odyssey (Harvard Univ Press, 2008).

***Contribution:**  Students are expected to attend class, to have completed the reading, and to be prepared to discuss not only the major arguments of the work, but how the works demonstrate the possibilities of Atlantic World History and the intricacies of historical research.   

**During class:** Be on time.  Either turn off your cell phone or set it on ― silent. Do not leave it on vibrate. No texting in class. Laptops are not permitted in class (except during Work Days), as they tend to distract not only the user but also people seated around him or her. Your focus during class should be on the material.

**Contribution**

Denison, and History at Denison, are about the exchange of ideas. Rather
than thinking about contribution as something for you (an assignment),
think of it as an obligation to your classmates. They deserve for you to
be prepared, engaged, and to share your ideas so that they can more
thoroughly engage the material and the major questions we are
considering.

You are expected to attend class, to have completed the assigned reading
beforehand, and to contribute to our classroom conversations. Share your
ideas, questions, thoughts and respond thoughtfully, empathetically, and
meaningfully to the ideas of others. No small task.

Our discussions may feel a little different this semester because we will spend equal time on the arguments scholars make AND and exploration of the moves they make as writers, both good and bad.

***Opening Essay:***<br> 
Due in-class on Thurs, Jan 22.  Based on the readings, write a 5-page essay that best articulates your understanding of what constitutes the “History of the Atlantic World.”  The goal is to engage the authors, identify common arguments and/or significant disagreements among them, and to chart what you find most convincing and most interesting about their arguments regarding the History of the Atlantic World.  You might include what you find most compelling about conceptualizing history from an Atlantic perspective.  Proper footnotes are required, see Research Paper instructions if you are unclear on proper citation styles for historians.  

**Final Version: Due Tues, Feb 3** – You will have the opportunity to revise your paper following our in-class conversations.  The goal here, in part, is to impress upon you the value of the revision process.  Your final grade on the paper will be based on a combination of my assessment of the two drafts (so, don’t phone-in the initial draft, doing so will significantly undermine your grade).

***Reading Responses:***<br>
Over the course of the semester, you will be asked to write three short responses for the remaining six (5) sets of assigned secondary source readings (excluding the first set of readings). Your review should consist of two parts. In the first, please provide a paragraph length summary of each reading (no more than 4-5 sentences each, work on brevity).  In the second, which should be no more than 500-600 words, address the following questions: how do the readings, in combination, rise to the level of Atlantic World History?  Do the individual readings rise to the level of Atlantic History? Why or why not? Do not explicate the primary sources; the goal here is to focus on the arguments that historians are making. These should be type written, double-spaced, in 12-point font with proper citations.

In addition, you should include at least 2 questions for discussion in these responses.  The professor may call upon you to share those questions with the class in order to initiate or further class discussions. Failure to include discussion questions will prevent you from receiving full credit on your response.
The responses will be due at 2pm on day we discuss the readings so that I can read them, make comments, and return them to you when class begins for use during our discussions.

***Research Accountability Assignment***<br>

**Purpose:** This weekly assignment helps you develop essential research management skills by planning your work intentionally and reflecting honestly on your progress.

**Format:** 300-400 words total; you can keep this as a journal (add your weekly update at the top of the page)<br>
**Frequency:** Weekly (due every Friday by 5pm]

**Part 1: Weekly Plan (150-200 words)**<br>
Write this at the **beginning** of each week.

Include:
- **Specific tasks** you will complete (be concrete: "draft introduction, pages 1-3" not "work on paper")
- **Timeline** for each task (day/time you plan to work on it)
- **Anticipated challenges** or obstacles

**Example:**
> *Monday 2-4pm: Review and annotate 3 articles on X topic*<br>
> *Wednesday 10am-12pm: Draft research question and outline*<br>
> *Friday 3-5pm: Begin coding interview data (first 2 interviews)*<br>
> *Challenge: May need extra time if the coding framework needs adjustment*

**Part 2: Progress Reflection (150-200 words)**<br>
Write this at the **end** of the week.

Include:
- **What you actually completed** (be honest)
- **What worked well** in your planning/execution
- **What interfered** with your plan (if applicable)
- **One adjustment** you'll make for next week

**Example:**
> *Completed: Annotated 2 articles, drafted partial outline*<br>
> *Didn't complete: Third article, research question, coding*<br>
> *What worked: Blocking specific times helped me focus*<br>
> *What interfered: Underestimated annotation time; midterm in another class*<br>
> *Adjustment: Will plan for 45 min/article instead of 30 min; build in buffer time*

**Grading:**<br>
This is graded on **completion and honesty**, not on perfect execution, spelling and/or grammar. You earn full credit by:
- Submitting on time
- Making specific, concrete plans
- Reflecting honestly on your progress

**No penalty for not completing planned work**—the goal is learning to plan realistically.

The responses and accountability statements will be graded on a credit (+), ¾ credit (√+), half credit (√-) or no credit (0) basis.

***Late Papers:***<br>  Only late papers (other than reading responses AND drafts of the Initial Paper and the Proposal) accompanied by a valid excuse (illness with doctor's note, university sanctioned extra-curricular activity, family emergency, etc.) will be accepted without penalty.  All other late papers will be penalized one full letter grade on the day following the due date (A to B) and one third of a letter grade (B to B-) for each day after that.  Missed assignments will be assigned a score of zero.

***Departmental Attendance Policy:***<br> Because this culminating course of the history major the history department views student absences as especially problematic.  Departmental policy reads “You are allowed two absences over the course of the semester. Per department policy, your third absence triggers an automatic penalty of a full letter grade for the entire semester. After your fourth absence, you fail the course. This includes all class meetings, Work Days, and individual meetings with me. There will be no exceptions.”

***Academic Integrity:*** Please do your own work.  Plagiarism will not be tolerated in any form.  The students and faculty of Denison University are committed to academic integrity and will not tolerate any violation of this principle.  Academic honesty, the cornerstone of teaching and learning, lays the foundation for lifelong integrity. 

<div style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
<img src="media/integrity.jpg" alt="Academic Integrity" style="width: 150px; height: auto;">
</div>Academic dishonesty is, in most cases, intellectual theft. It includes, but is not limited to, providing or receiving assistance in a manner not authorized by the instructor in the creation of work to be submitted for evaluation. This standard applies to all work ranging from daily homework assignments to major exams. Students must clearly cite any sources consulted—not only for quoted phrases but also for ideas and information that are not common knowledge. Neither ignorance nor carelessness is an acceptable defense in cases of plagiarism. It is the student’s responsibility to follow the appropriate format for citations. Students should ask the professor for assistance in determining what sorts of materials and assistance are appropriate for assignments and for guidance in citing such materials clearly. 

Proposed and developed by Denison students, passed unanimously by DCGA and Denison’s faculty, the Code of Academic Integrity requires that instructors notify the Associate Provost of cases of academic dishonesty, and it requires that cases be heard by the Academic Integrity Board. Further, the code makes students responsible for promoting a culture of integrity on campus and acting in instances in which integrity is violated.  The punishment for plagiarism/academic dishonesty in this class will be a grade of zero for the assignment in question and potentially a failing grade for the course in egregious cases.

***Disability Statement:***  Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact me privately as soon as possible to discuss his or her specific needs.  I rely on the Academic Support & Enrichment Center in 104 Doane to verify the need for reasonable accommodations.

***AI Policies***

The development of generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are transforming the landscape of higher education. With that reality in mind, here are some guiding principles for the use of AI in our course (other faculty may have different policies, and it is **YOUR** responsibility to know what each of your professors determine is the acceptable and ethical use of AI in their courses).

AI **should not be used** to produce the final product (Please don't ask AI to "write a paper" for you, or sections of a paper for you, you're only cheating yourself)
- AI might be appropriate as a piece of the process of identifying a topic and theme to write your papers on. It might be helpful to identify the author and their historical context to better understand your source(s). 


- RECOGNIZE that my primary interest is to know what YOU THINK about the material. (I don’t care what a computer might produce as representing the “hive mind” or “groupthink ” best answer to a question based on what others have written.)

- If you consult AI, Academic Integrity requires that you ACKNOWLEDGE such use to your readers. Do so in a footnote. In a sentence, explain your use of AI and identify the tool(s) you consulted.

    - **Do not CITE AI.** Citations are meant to identify the work of other humans that you have consulted, and to provide a clear path to your evidence for your readers should they want to consult it themselves. AI-produced information is not reproducible, and thus is not a valid source.

***The course adheres to Denison's Academic Credit Policy.*** Significant feedback on writing is a core
component of this course. Students are expected to review instructor
feedback and reflect on how to incorporate that into their future work.
Students will be required to complete pre- or post-writing assignments
before and after official course meetings.

# Research Paper:<br> 

**DUE: Full Draft:** Thurs, April 16
  - DUE: **Revision Plan** Before individual meetings (Wednesday April 22 @ 11:59pm)<br>

**DUE: Final Draft** Wed, May 6 at 11am

The primary object of the History Senior Seminar is for you to write an independent, original, research paper fundamentally grounded in primary source materials (20 page + bibliography minimum w/ proper footnotes).  The goal is for this assignment to serve as a culmination of your career at Denison as a student of history. You might conceive of it as your opportunity to write an article-length piece of original scholarship.  For this particular class, the paper must focus on the History of the Atlantic World (which we will define more accurately together over the course of our discussions), 1400-1890, roughly.  The work must be grounded in one or more primary sources and draw widely upon secondary sources (journal articles and books). 

**Warning:** This is not the equivalent of a high school report, it is an opportunity for you to produce original historical research. The research paper is to be fundamentally grounded in primary documents.  It should not be an encyclopedic summary of other historians' arguments or a narrative of events taken from secondary sources, but the presentation of your own arguments based on your readings of available primary sources and the pertinent secondary literature.  Over reliance on secondary sources will adversely affect your grade.

The paper will be graded primarily on the depth, breadth, and quality of your research, the originality of your arguments and their persuasiveness, and the quality of your writing.  

The paper should be typed, double-spaced, and in Times New Roman 12-point font.  It should have 1-inch margins on all sides and employ proper citations in footnotes and the bibliography.  Footnotes and bibliographies should follow the Chicago Manual of Style, 18th ed.  You may use short citations (last name, short title) after an initial full citation of the source has been given.  The paper will be due on Thursday, Dec 22nd, at 11am, but feel free to turn the assignment in early.  Please upload a completed copy of your paper to Notebowl.

**Hint:** If you don't already, you might consider using Zotero (a free bibliography program available at zotero.org)

One of the most difficult and yet crucial steps in the process will be to chose a historical problem and conceptualize a plan of how to frame your paper.  Because many of you are not familiar with the history of the Atlantic World you should probably begin by thinking broadly about the types of historical questions, sources, and approaches that have drawn your highest degree of interest during your history career rather than trying to come up with an argument at the start.  You might think of it in terms of what questions/problems within particular national histories you have found most compelling, and, what types of historical approaches or methodologies (women's, economic, gender, race/ethnicity, political, intellectual, etc.) have captured your attention in other courses.  With those ideas in mind, we can begin to brainstorm about the possibilities of conducting research on such a historical or historiographical question within an Atlantic framework.

Fundamental to this process is the locations of manageable and pertinent primary sources.  Once you have a general historical problem you would like to explore, the next and most important step is to identify primary sources.  Your historical questions, and the subsequent answers to those questions (your hypotheses) should emanate out of your reading of the primary sources.

I have provided an initial list of potential published primary sources (and there are so many more that we might find), but you will need to quickly move from a consideration of potential projects/questions to whether or not your project is manageable both in terms of available primary and secondary materials as well as time constraints.  

Once you have settled on a general historical problem (you will be required to submit a Initial Statement of Research Questions and Sources on Sept. 14th) you will need to do lots of reading and note taking and begin to think about what your big historical and/or historiographical questions will be.  Hint: As you read, take copious notes (with reference to exactly what you are reading and where you find it).

At this point, you should still be thinking about questions (derived in large part from you reading of primary materials) rather than arguments.  You will also need to discover if other historians have attempted to answer your questions.  (Email me a Research Proposal and Description on Sept 25th; see description below for specific instructions).

Thereafter, there are a series of benchmark assignments that you will be required to complete in order to help you towards completing your research project.  They will include two (2) Primary Source Analyses (1st Complete Draft Oct 17th, 1st Final Draft Oct 19th; 2nd Complete Draft Nov 9th, Final Draft Nov 14th), an Annotated Bibliography and Historiography Outline (Oct 24th), a Historiographical Essay (Complete Draft Oct 31st, Final Draft Nov 2nd), a rough draft of your paper for peer review (Nov 30th), and finally a Plan for Revision (Due Dec 5th before one-on-one meetings to discuss Rough Drafts).  Specific instructions for each assignment are below.

In writing your final project, it might behoove you to keep the following in mind.
  - Include a theoretical discussion on the concept of the Atlantic world (which can be drawn, in part, from the initial writing assignment)<br>
  - A critical discussion of what an "Atlantic" perspective can or cannot reveal about your general theme and historical questions
  - How, if at all, your perspective on your theme and/or your questions has changed as a result of using an Atlantic World perspective. 
	
***Hints:***
  - Make sure that your opening sentence is well written and that everything in it is factually correct.
  - Ensure that your citations in your footnotes are correct (failure to do so will result in a 1/3 grade penalty)
  - When using long quotes, do not expect them to speak for themselves. You must explain what the quote means to you in the context of your larger argument

***Some Grading Criteria***
  - A paper that is not fundamentally grounded in the examination of primary sources cannot earn higher than a D as a final grade
  - A paper that does not present a historical argument cannot earn higher than a C as a final grade
  - A paper that is not explicitly grounded in an Atlantic World perspective cannot earn higher than a B as a final grade<br>

  - You can find a rubric for the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aVjxPIJk0M_yjfpgJ253R7nMTLj4SOLhA38R2bmduS4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">final here</a>

# Assignments Related to Final Project
## Initial Thoughts on Historical Question/Problem<br>
Please submit a 1-2 paragraph description of a general idea for your research project, and some thoughts as to what types of primary sources that you might be interested in employing.  Then we will schedule individual meetings to discuss the possibilities of your general topic.  (Due Mon, Feb 2 at 11:59pm)

## Project Proposal (5%)<br>
Please submit a detailed description of your evolving Project that describes your historical question(s), historiographical question(s), and any questions you might have about your project.  Also include an initial bibliography of at least ten (10) secondary sources, and a description/discussion of the primary sources that you plan/hope to employ.  You should not have arguments yet (tentative hypotheses at best), the arguments should come from the primary sources!<br>

*Note:* This should represent a refined statement of your research plan and not simply a reiteration of what was included in your "First Thoughts".  It should represent the growth and increased focus of you topic.
Project Proposal graded on a full credit (+), ¾ credit (√+), half credit (√-) or no credit (0) basis.
*Complete Draft* Due: Tues, Feb 17
*Final Draft* Due: Tues, Feb 24

## Primary Source Analysis x2 (5% each)<br>
Open your paper with a two to three paragraph description of your project.  That description should represent an evolution of what you wrote in your Proposal, and should provide a foundation for your explication of your primary source.<br>
You are to identify and critically analyze one of the more significant primary documents for your research paper. If your source base relies on a vareity of smaller sources (say, newspaper articles), you should analyze multiple sources.<br>

Approach this assignment as if you are the first person to have discovered your primary source(s); and you wish to express what it contains, and its meaning(s) and significance to a fellow historian (me).  In addition, you should consider what the document doesn't say: what can't it tell us?  What sort of questions do the sources raise that can only be answered with other sources, primary or secondary?

Most importantly, you need to situate the document within the general questions of your specific research.  How does it help you articulate, and potentially answer, the questions most central to your study?  
Your analysis should focus on why this document was written, the meaning of the document in the context of your research, the assumptions and arguments that form the basis of the document, and the potential implications of the source for your project and Atlantic World History.

The Source Analysis should be a maximum of 4 double-spaced typewritten pages and should follow the general format instructions for the final paper.  Please include a copy or (or a hyperlink to) the document you are analyzing if possible.

The professor must approve the primary source(s) you plan to use in advance.

### Primary Source Analysis #1 
Due: Complete Draft for Peer Review: Tues, March 3; <br> Final Draft: Thurs, March 5 (via Canvas).<br>  If reasonable, please deliver a copy of your primary source, or the section of the source, that you evaluate along with your paper.  

### Primary Source Analysis #2 
Due: Complete Draft for Peer Review: Thurs, April 2; <br> Final Draft: Tues, April 7 (via Canvas).<br>  If reasonable, please deliver a copy of your primary source, or the section of the source, that you evaluate along with your paper. 

**Annotated Bibliography and Outline of Historiography (5%)**<br>

## Annotated Bibliography<br>
You will need to include a minimum of ten (10) secondary sources, including three articles in scholarly journals, as well as an initial list of the primary sources you plan to employ.  You should also annotate the important primary sources you plan to use (and can annotate them as a "collection" (say a collection of letters) if necessary). The key is not just having the appropriate number of sources but to identify those sources most relevant to your topic.  Remember to pay particular attention to the date and place of publication in addition to any basic information that might be available about the author as you make your selections.<br>

Your annotated bibliography should include each of the four components listed below:
  - 1) A refined, revised statement of your research proposal that identifies the major questions, issues, and hypotheses of your research (first identified in your Proposal and refined in your Primary Source Analysis). This should be accomplishable in 200-300 words.  Doing do will provide a basis for your discussion of how the sources you annotate will contribute to your larger study.<br>
  - 2) Historiographical Outline. History as a discipline is best described as an ongoing conversation in which scholars engage and react to the scholarship that has come before.  Historiography is your articulation of those conversations and debates (see the instructions below for more clarity).  The goal of this exercise is to identify and describe at least three (3) layers of debate that surround your particular topic.
  - 3) Complete bibliographic citations of your primary sources.
  - 4) Evaluative annotations for at least ten of your secondary sources. Each source (with full bibliographic citation) must be followed by a paragraph-long annotation that identifies the central thesis of the work in question relative to your work AND contain your evaluative comments indicating the nature of the source, any special problems it might pose, and how it will contribute to your work (you should refer back to your opening here).  In other word, explain the value of the source to your work<br>

Include separate sections for primary and secondary sources.

*Note:* While ten sources might seem a significant number, it represents a bare minimum.  For the sake of comparison, two of my published articles include 32 and 48 cited secondary sources, which would not include the other materials I consulted but did not need to cite.

## Historiographical Essay (7.5%)<br>
Write an approximately 750-word, double-spaced, 12 pt font, historiographical essay, with proper footnotes, on your research project. <br> 

**DUE:**
Complete Draft: Tues, March 24
Final Draft: Thurs, March 26

### Description:<br>
As a historian, you are contributing to ongoing scholarly conversation relevant to your research. In your final paper, you will want to position your own arguments relative to those conversations. 

You will identify and describe the various historiographical debates that your topic addresses. Again, your essay should open with a further revised two to three paragraph description of your research problem that will serve as the frame for your discussion of other historians work.

Historians generally disagree on how to interpret the issues that we study.  Therefore, your analysis should reveal the approach and basic argument of these works (as they relate to your topic) and the points of conflict and/or agreement between them.

In other words, you will reconstruct appropriate aspects of the conversations that have gone on among scholars regarding your area of investigation over time.  You should also position your research project amidst those debates, revealing where your topic and/or thesis fit into this conversation.  

What are the key differences between a traditional "research" paper and a historiographical essay?  The former, a research paper, focuses on actual events, processes, or questions.  The later, the historiography, critically examines the scholarship on a given topic, historical period, or event.  "Critically" means that you must not only identify but also critique the arguments about actual events, processes, or historical questions.  In such a paper, you refer to events, periods, processes, only in relation to others' interpretations of the past.  In addition, the purpose of a historiographical essay is not to prove one or another approach as correct, but rather to identify and critique all, or at least the most significant, approaches.

You are likely to find that there are various levels of conversation that you will want to discuss.  For example, we have already discussed the meanings of "Atlantic World History" from a historiographical perspective in class.  You might then identify other sets of debates particular to your specific topic within that more general perspective.  For clarity's sake, you should identify multiple and potentially layered historiographical debates in this paper.

The historiography should be structured around arguments, debates, and/or approaches and not around individual authors.  (If you historiography reads like an annotated bibliography in narrative form, you should consider restructuring it).

**Hint and Warning:**  
The historiographical essay should be a good tool to assist you in writing your final paper.  You should not, however, simply cut and paste significant sections of the historiography into your final paper.  Doing so will adversely affect your grade.  

In addition, you are required to append the historiographical essay to the final draft of your paper as an appendix.  Final papers that do not have a historiographical essay attached will be treated as incomplete.

Due: Complete Draft for Peer Review, Oct 31st;  Final Draft, Nov 2nd via Canvas.

## Primary Source Analysis #2 (5%)<br>

See instructions above, follow same format as Primary Source Analysis 1.

The professor must approve the primary source(s) you plan to use in advance.  Unless explicitly given permission to do otherwise, you should write on a different source than the one you analyzed in your first primary source analysis.


## Full Draft -  This must be a full, polished draft of your final paper.

On Thurs, April 16, class will meet to conduct peer-reviews of complete drafts. You will be asked to read a couple of pages out loud to the author (so they hear their own prose and writing style) and then to read and comment on the entirety of the draft during the class period.  I will provide a general worksheet to assist you in this process during class. <br>

Please bring two copies to class to share with your peer reviewers and upload a version of your paper to Canvas for grading. <br>

Drafts graded on a full credit (+), ¾ credit (√+), half credit (√-) or no credit (0) basis.  

To receive full credit you must have a full draft, with a well-identified historical question, an arguable and manageable hypothesis, which begins to grapple with the pertinent primary and secondary materials. 

***Presentations (7.5%)***
Per departmental policy, you will be required to provide a 10-minute presentation (with additional 5 minutes for Q&A) on your topic on Thurs, April 30 (10am-12noon).  You should be able to address your primary questions, the primary sources you've employed to answer those questions, and your principle conclusions. <br>

Treat this as a formal presentation – dress appropriately, and be prepared to field questions from the instructor, your classmates, and other faculty from the history department regarding your project. 

I will be strict with the time limit.  A good estimate is less than 5 typewritten pages will fill your 10 minutes.  However, you would be better served to avoid reading your talk, and coming prepared to simply talk about your project.

I would recommend that you avoid the temptation to summarize your project but rather consider organizing your presentation around the following themes:

  - Research Questions, Thesis and Argument:  What is the topic of your research?  What is the primary research question that drives your project?  Why is it of interest to you and of significance for others?  What are the major historiographical arguments surrounding your research?  What is your thesis?  What are the main points of your supporting argument?  
  - Sources:  What types of primary (not secondary) sources did you use?  Where there particular challenges that you confronted in working with these sources?  What sources do you wish you could find but could not?
  - Reflections: What observations do you have on the experience of doing a project of this kind?  What have you learned about the nature of history in the process?  How have you grown as a historian? This section should be short.

The strength of your own presentation and your participation, in terms of asking questions and making suggestions to fellow students during these presentations, will be included in your discussion grade for the course.
- *Hint #1:* While PowerPoint may be used to facilitate your presentation, please do not rely on it.  Rather than listing all your major points and/or including long quotes on PowerPoint, and then reading them aloud to the audience, use it sparingly for major questions or images, etc.
*- Hint #2* – Listen carefully to the questions that your peers and members of the department ask you.  Those questions can often serve as important indicators of potential revisions on the paper you could make before submitting the final version.
