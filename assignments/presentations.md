**Date:** {{ site.data.due_dates.presentations }}

## Requirements

Per departmental policy, you will be required to provide a 10-minute presentation (with additional 5 minutes for Q&A) on your topic. You should be able to address your primary questions, the primary sources you've employed to answer those questions, and your principle conclusions.

Treat this as a formal presentation – dress appropriately, and be prepared to field questions from the instructor, your classmates, and other faculty from the history department regarding your project.

## Time Limit

I will be strict with the time limit. A good estimate is less than 5 typewritten pages will fill your 10 minutes. However, you would be better served to avoid reading your talk, and coming prepared to simply talk about your project.

## Suggested Organization

I would recommend that you avoid the temptation to summarize your project but rather consider organizing your presentation around the following themes:

- **Research Questions, Thesis and Argument:** What is the topic of your research? What is the primary research question that drives your project? Why is it of interest to you and of significance for others? What are the major historiographical arguments surrounding your research? What is your thesis? What are the main points of your supporting argument?

- **Sources:** What types of primary (not secondary) sources did you use? Were there particular challenges that you confronted in working with these sources? What sources do you wish you could find but could not?

- **Reflections:** What observations do you have on the experience of doing a project of this kind? What have you learned about the nature of history in the process? How have you grown as a historian? This section should be short.

## Grading

The strength of your own presentation and your participation, in terms of asking questions and making suggestions to fellow students during these presentations, will be included in your discussion grade for the course.

## Hints

- **Hint #1:** While PowerPoint may be used to facilitate your presentation, please do not rely on it. Rather than listing all your major points and/or including long quotes on PowerPoint, and then reading them aloud to the audience, use it sparingly for major questions or images, etc.

- **Hint #2:** Listen carefully to the questions that your peers and members of the department ask you. Those questions can often serve as important indicators of potential revisions on the paper you could make before submitting the final version.
