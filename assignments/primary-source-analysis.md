# Primary Source Analysis (5% each)

## Assignment Overview

Open your paper with a two to three paragraph description of your project. That description should represent an evolution of what you wrote in your Proposal, and should provide a foundation for your explication of your primary source.

You are to identify and critically analyze one of the more significant primary documents for your research paper. If your source base relies on a variety of smaller sources (say, newspaper articles), you should analyze multiple sources.

Approach this assignment as if you are the first person to have discovered your primary source(s); and you wish to express what it contains, and its meaning(s) and significance to a fellow historian (me). In addition, you should consider what the document doesn't say: what can't it tell us? What sort of questions do the sources raise that can only be answered with other sources, primary or secondary?

Most importantly, you need to situate the document within the general questions of your specific research. How does it help you articulate, and potentially answer, the questions most central to your study?

Your analysis should focus on why this document was written, the meaning of the document in the context of your research, the assumptions and arguments that form the basis of the document, and the potential implications of the source for your project and Atlantic World History.

The Source Analysis should be a maximum of 4 double-spaced typewritten pages and should follow the general format instructions for the final paper. Please include a copy or (or a hyperlink to) the document you are analyzing if possible.

**The professor must approve the primary source(s) you plan to use in advance.**
