## Assignment

Write an approximately 750-word, double-spaced, 12 pt font, historiographical essay, with proper footnotes, on your research project.

## Description

As a historian, you are contributing to ongoing scholarly conversation relevant to your research. In your final paper, you will want to position your own arguments relative to those conversations.

You will identify and describe the various historiographical debates that your topic addresses. Again, your essay should open with a further revised two to three paragraph description of your research problem that will serve as the frame for your discussion of other historians work.

Historians generally disagree on how to interpret the issues that we study. Therefore, your analysis should reveal the approach and basic argument of these works (as they relate to your topic) and the points of conflict and/or agreement between them.

In other words, you will reconstruct appropriate aspects of the conversations that have gone on among scholars regarding your area of investigation over time. You should also position your research project amidst those debates, revealing where your topic and/or thesis fit into this conversation.

## What is a Historiographical Essay?

What are the key differences between a traditional "research" paper and a historiographical essay? The former, a research paper, focuses on actual events, processes, or questions. The later, the historiography, critically examines the scholarship on a given topic, historical period, or event. "Critically" means that you must not only identify but also critique the arguments about actual events, processes, or historical questions. In such a paper, you refer to events, periods, processes, only in relation to others' interpretations of the past. In addition, the purpose of a historiographical essay is not to prove one or another approach as correct, but rather to identify and critique all, or at least the most significant, approaches.

You are likely to find that there are various levels of conversation that you will want to discuss. For example, we have already discussed the meanings of "Atlantic World History" from a historiographical perspective in class. You might then identify other sets of debates particular to your specific topic within that more general perspective. For clarity's sake, you should identify multiple and potentially layered historiographical debates in this paper.

The historiography should be structured around arguments, debates, and/or approaches and not around individual authors. (If your historiography reads like an annotated bibliography in narrative form, you should consider restructuring it).

## Hint and Warning

The historiographical essay should be a good tool to assist you in writing your final paper. You should not, however, simply cut and paste significant sections of the historiography into your final paper. Doing so will adversely affect your grade.

In addition, you are required to append the historiographical essay to the final draft of your paper as an appendix. Final papers that do not have a historiographical essay attached will be treated as incomplete.
