# Annotated Bibliography and Outline of Historiography (5%)

**Due:** {{ site.data.due_dates.annotated_bibliography }}

## Requirements

You will need to include a minimum of ten (10) secondary sources, including three articles in scholarly journals, as well as an initial list of the primary sources you plan to employ. You should also annotate the important primary sources you plan to use (and can annotate them as a "collection" (say a collection of letters) if necessary). The key is not just having the appropriate number of sources but to identify those sources most relevant to your topic. Remember to pay particular attention to the date and place of publication in addition to any basic information that might be available about the author as you make your selections.

## Four Required Components

Your annotated bibliography should include each of the four components listed below:

1. **A refined, revised statement of your research proposal** that identifies the major questions, issues, and hypotheses of your research (first identified in your Proposal and refined in your Primary Source Analysis). This should be accomplishable in 200-300 words. Doing so will provide a basis for your discussion of how the sources you annotate will contribute to your larger study.

2. **Historiographical Outline.** History as a discipline is best described as an ongoing conversation in which scholars engage and react to the scholarship that has come before. Historiography is your articulation of those conversations and debates (see the instructions below for more clarity). The goal of this exercise is to identify and describe at least three (3) layers of debate that surround your particular topic.

3. **Complete bibliographic citations of your primary sources.**

4. **Evaluative annotations for at least ten of your secondary sources.** Each source (with full bibliographic citation) must be followed by a paragraph-long annotation that identifies the central thesis of the work in question relative to your work AND contain your evaluative comments indicating the nature of the source, any special problems it might pose, and how it will contribute to your work (you should refer back to your opening here). In other word, explain the value of the source to your work.

## Format

Include separate sections for primary and secondary sources.

**Note:** While ten sources might seem a significant number, it represents a bare minimum. For the sake of comparison, two of my published articles include 32 and 48 cited secondary sources, which would not include the other materials I consulted but did not need to cite.
