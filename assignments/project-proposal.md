# Project Proposal (5%)

**Complete Draft Due:** {{ site.data.due_dates.project_proposal_draft }}  
**Final Draft Due:** {{ site.data.due_dates.project_proposal_final }}

Please submit a detailed description of your evolving Project that describes your historical question(s), historiographical question(s), and any questions you might have about your project. Also include an initial bibliography of at least ten (10) secondary sources, and a description/discussion of the primary sources that you plan/hope to employ. You should not have arguments yet (tentative hypotheses at best), the arguments should come from the primary sources!

**Note:** This should represent a refined statement of your research plan and not simply a reiteration of what was included in your "First Thoughts". It should represent the growth and increased focus of you topic.
