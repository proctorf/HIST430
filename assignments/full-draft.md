# Full Draft - Research Paper (5%)

**Due:** {{ site.data.due_dates.complete_draft }}

## Assignment

This must be a full, polished draft of your final paper.

On {{ site.data.due_dates.complete_draft }}, class will meet to conduct peer-reviews of complete drafts. You will be asked to read a couple of pages out loud to the author (so they hear their own prose and writing style) and then to read and comment on the entirety of the draft during the class period. I will provide a general worksheet to assist you in this process during class.

## Submission

Please bring two copies to class to share with your peer reviewers and upload a version of your paper to Canvas for grading.

## Grading

Drafts graded on a full credit (+), ¾ credit (√+), half credit (√-) or no credit (0) basis.

To receive full credit you must have a full draft, with a well-identified historical question, an arguable and manageable hypothesis, which begins to grapple with the pertinent primary and secondary materials.
